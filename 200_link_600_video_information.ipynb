Experts say there's a slight chance this could trigger an immune response on top of the vaccine. Your best bet it to wait a few days.2. Don't book other vaccines. Scientists say there's just not enough evidence right now to know how the vaccines interact with others in a short period of time. They recommend waiting at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination.3. Don't push yourself too hard to exercise. If you feel bad after getting your shot, take the day off instead. Forcing yourself to workout might only make you feel even worse. 4. Do not panic. After getting the vaccine, you might experience normal side effects like fever, nausea, muscle pain etc. But these are normal so there is no need to panic. Because panicking will only make things worse.5. Don't lose your vaccine certificate. We don't know exactly where or when we'll need it just yet, but whatever you do, keep your vaccine card in a safe place.Do share this video with your loved ones.Take care.

In this video, we are showing you some unique village food in Sri Lanka. First, we meet some local women in the village of Wellawaya. At the time of filming, the Sri Lankan New Year celebrations just happened and we had the opportunity to watch these ladies prepare Sri Lankan New Year specialties from scratch. The ladies prepared Imbul Kiribath (traditional milk rice stuffed with coconut), Welithalapa (rice flour, coconut milk and treacle), Kokis (deep fried cookies made from rice flour and coconut milk), and Kavum (a pastry made from rice flour and treacle that’s deep fried and shaped like a woman’s bun). We were served these Sri Lankan treats with tea and it was all very unique and delicious!!! Next, we visited a sustainable rice paddy field where farmers harvest a unique and traditional rice grain which has been around for thousands of years and is much more nutritious than normal rice found around the world. We met up with a few of these rice farmers and shared a lotus leaf meal with the Sri Lankan rice. This meal was also cooked by the village ladies and it was absolutely amazing!!  We would like to thank the rice farmers and the village women for their hard work, and also Jetwing Kaduruketha ( ) for arranging this Agricultural and Sustainable culinary experience!________________________We’re Luke Martin and Sabrina Davidson, food lovers and world travellers!

We are taking you deep into the Sri Lankan forest to introduce the culture of the Vedda people. The Veddas are the indigenous people of Sri Lanka, and have inhabited the island long before any other groups. They used to inhabit the coasts, the mountains and regions from North to South Sri Lanka. Sadly, there aren’t many Veddas left. Today, we are meeting a local Vedda and to get to him we will need to take a boat. We are joining our friends from Ojaye Camp (Check them out:   &  ) Chathura, who is a local to this area and can speak the Vedda language. Thank you so much Ojaye Camp!Meet Suda, a Vedda tribesman from the Mahiyanganaya region of Sri Lanka. As you can see from his bow and arrow, belongings and shelter, Veddas are hunter-gatherers. The jungles and nearby lake are rich with natural resources, and Suda had tons of local spices with him. He also recently hunted nearby, and had fresh meat to cook into a curry. Watching the process of Suda cook was impressive. Everything was made by hand from scratch with ingredients foraged from the nearby lands. Even the wood fire was lit with flint and stone! Suda prepared many dishes like Thalapa (boiled cornmeal), meat curry and wood-fire roti. The food prepared was absolutely delicious!!! Suda, along with other Veddas are preserving their identity, culture and traditions in Sri Lanka, and we recommend learning about the indigenous people and their history through meeting them and experiencing something like this. The Veddas have their own language, rituals, hunting and survival techniques. Even their own cuisine! We would like to thank Chathura, of Ojaye Camp, for helping us to learn about the Sri Lankan Veddas! Go check them out!   ________________________We’re Luke Martin and Sabrina Davidson, food lovers and world travellers! We make videos about local, authentic and unique foods from across the globe.

       "  '    Kolkata New Market Area is widely popular for its best street food stalls and shops. People from all around the country and tourists often visit this area and overwhelmed by the variety of delicious street foods available to choose from.  We have tried some of the best street foods they had to offer in the new market area of Kolkata and in this video you will see 3 items out of them.Make sure to Subscribe to The Travel Eaters here:► Make sure to follow The Travel Eaters behind the scenes here:► Firstly we were walking down the foothpath beside the Kolkata new market area Big Bazar and found some street vendos selling momos, fries , dosa, kulcha and other friend or steamed items. We stopped by and ordered masala dosa. The price was only 30 rupees or $0.4 US. While doing our Kolkata food blog we visited many places that offer masala dosa. But for the price and taste I would keep this dosa in mostly top position on my list. Next we ordered momo. Momo is a common snack of Kolkata food tour. Although it is a Chinese-Tibetan dish, momo is found in most places of Kolkata Food Street. It was served steamy hot with clear soup and sour sauce. I found the momo goes really well while eaten with the clear soup. We were eating momos sitting in front of Kolkata New Market Big Bazar stairs like the locals. I think Kolkata Local people really like to grab some street snacks after some shopping.Finally after some food walk around the Kolkata New Market Area we stopped by an ice-cream cart opposite to Sree Leathers. The cart was named “Kamal’s real Ice-cream”. We were astonished by the cheap price of the ice cream they sell for. A scoop of ice-cream starts from 10 rupees or $0.10 US only. We ordered 2 flavors of ice cream. Chocolate-Vanilla & Mixed fruit scoops. It was really a gem of our Kolkata food tour.

       "  \"      Dhaka to Kolkata by Bus Train & Metro.ঢাকা থেকে কলকাতা বাই বাস ট্রেন ও মেট্রো।Make sure to Subscribe to The Travel Eaters here:► Make sure to follow The Travel Eaters behind the scenes here:► Disclaimer: 555 Tk Dhaka to Kolkata by Bus Train and Metro without Travel Tax and other chargers that you are supposed to pay already in Sonali Bank if you are crossing the border by land which is 542.75 Tk additional.►Here is the Journey:We had started our journey from Dhaka Kolkata Bus Stand at Kollyanpur from where most of the Dhaka to Kolkata buses starts. Some buses also start from Motijheel Arambag bus counter. But we chose Kollyanpur as it is close to our home. We had purchased 2 Dhaka to Benapole Tickets for 500 tk each. Benapole is the land port that is highly used by the Bangladeshi people traveling to India as that port is the nearest port to Kolkata, a city of India. As we were traveling to Kolkata we selected that port as well. We rode on the bus at 11:30 am and reached the Paturia-Doulotdia Ferry Pier at 4 am. After crossing the mighty Padma River through ferry we finally reached our destination Benapole at around 7:30 am in the morning. After some short rest at the bus counter we entered the Benapole Land Port Immigration Building. We paid our travel tax of 500 tk, terminal usages and other charges of 42 tk at the Sonali Bank's counter at the terminal building. After that we entered the immigration section, completed the immigration procedure in Bangladesh side, crossed the zero point and entered the Indian Side.On the Indian Side we had to stand in a long queue unlike Bangladesh side, so it took some time to finish the immigration procedure. After that we left the immigration terminal building and exchanged some money to Indian rupee to pay for the rest of the journey. Money exchange rate is really good if not too bad unlike airports. Then we headed towards the taxi station just beside the immigration terminal building to take a shared three wheeler taxi to Bongaon Railway Station. It is the nearest railway station to the border. Paying 30 rupees taxi fare per person we have reached the railway station. You can also go directly to Kolkata by bus from beanpole border for 400 rupees each but we chose the cheaper option.Afterwards we were all set to head towards Bongaon to Kolkata by train. We purchased 2 tickets to Dumdum from Bongaon for 15 rupees each. We chose dumdum as there is a Metro station adjacent to the railway station that can easily take us to our destination Kolkata. We rode on the train and after only 1 and a half hour journey we reached dumdum. If you just go downstairs from there you will get the Dumdum Metro Station. We went there, purchased 2 tickets again to Kolkata New Market Area (Metro station name: Esplanade) and hopped on to the metro rail. In about 15 minutes or so we reached our destination Esplanade Metro Station.That was all about the whole journey from Dhaka to Kolkata.Keep Following The Travel Eaters for more Food & Travel Videos:Team Members:Host: Md.

       "  'Live beyond boundaries they say, but HOW!!! It\\'s not so simple to be scared of heights one day, and to be jumping out of a plane the other, only because \"it\\'s all in your head\", and because \"you\\'re greater than your fears\". It\\'s easier said than done right? I strongly believe that one must explore themselves, but it\\'s not very simple to get OVER your fears, BUT definitely possible to have fun while doing it. My life mantra is to have fun, no matter what you do. I\\'m always scared of most things, but I\\'m having the most fun from it always. Test yourself every day, challenge yourself and wake up with a newer you. Shock your reflection every day when you look in the mirror. There\\'s no better feeling than winning against yourself. You\\'re a champion either ways! this is not a sponsored video.

As you guys know i was born and bought up in Kolkata, India and i miss the food so much. I usually cook this several times in a year and we absolutely love it.So let's get cooking.Ingredients:* 5 Medium sized Potatoes* 2 pcs Onions* Half kg/1 lb Chicken (Preferably with bones/thigh piece)* Basmati Rice - about 600 gms* Bay Leaves- 7-8 pcs* Biryani Masala- 2-3 tsp* Kesari- as shown in the video* Rose water-2 tsp* Kewra Water-2 tsp* Biryani flavour( meetha attar)-1 tsp* Salt to taste* Yogurt- 2 tsp* Wheat Flour/Atta- 1 cupMethod:1. Peel the onion, cut into halves and slice it, keep it aside.2. Peel the potatoes and cut it into halves.3. In a pan, add some water, whole garam masala, kesari powder and some salt and bring it to a boil.4. Once the water boils, add the potatoes and cook it, strain the water once it is cooked.5. To marinate the chicken, we will add some kesari and salt and keep it aside for half an hour.6. In the meantime, pour the rice in a bowl and wash the rice and soak it for half an hour.7. In a pan, add some water, ghee, whole garam masala and salt and bring it to a boil, once the water boils add the soaked rice, the rice should be  parboiled and it should be 70 percent cooked, then strain the rice in a white muslin cloth, cover the rice and tie it with a clip. This will help the rice to cook with the help of the steam.8. Add some water to the wheat flout/atta and knead it and then keep it aside.9. Heat oil in the pan, fry the chicken, cook it about 2-3 minutes at one side. In the same oil you can also fry the potatoes.10. In another container/pan heat oil and ghee, add the garam masala powder, the ginger garlic juice, chicken, yogurt and salt.11. Thereafter add the potatoes, stir it slowly as you do not want the potatoes to break.12. Add the rice on top of the mixture, layer it until the top.13. Add the kewra water, biryani flavour (metha attar), rose water, ghee and kesari water on top of the rice.14. Now take the atta/ wheat flour, roll it and place it on all sides of the container/pan and cover the lid and place it on the flat non stick pan.15. After about 15 mins, open the lid and once you can smell the flavourful steam, it is cooked and ready to be served.Enjoy the flavourful Kolkata Style biryani.

       "  'Saturday Night Market is one of the biggest attraction of Goa, India. This market one of a kind, unique,hippie styled, will remind you of the 70’s bollywood song Dum maro Dum as you land up in the centre of the kadeiscopic Saturday night market.The Saturday Night market in Goa, as the name says is live only on Saturdays and it is an absolute worth visit.   The market is located near by 4 kms from the Baga Beach and 17 kilometres from the city’s capital Panjim. The night market is located on a huge valley next to the main road connecting Baga. Anjuna, and Assagao.Being the peak season and a lovely cool weather, I had made up my mind to experience the highly talked about sprawling Saturday Night market. As I neared to the location, I could feel the vibes; Extremely crowded, cars and bikes parked at both sides of the road, squeezing the wide road much narrower, people trying to make way to cross the road, music and car horns adding on to the upbeat shore, while I had to run my car twice in circles in  the same area, to find a parking spot on the red soil of the Saturday Night Market. There is no entry fee or a parking fee and the market remains open from eve 4:00pm to 11:00pm on Saturdays only. The crowd gathers and it at its peak from 8:00pm onwards just when I was entering the Saturday Night Market . There are three entry and exit points and from whichever point you enter, you will be caught up in the maze of this beautiful,colorful and vibrant market of Goa.As I walked passed the stalls of the Saturday Night Market, I observed, the locals are selling conch shells, ornaments made of sea shells, sea pearl necklaces, beaded with colorful stones. Earrings made of feathers, while some stalls are empty and the stall owner is trying his best to get customers in. In another small kisosk there is a huge crowd of ladies, trying to match their atiire with the perfect combination of earrings, buying everything at a fixed rate of INR 100. As I moved further inside the market, I could smell spices, sweet essence of vanilla, cinnamon, staraniese and with much curisosty I discovered shops, selling Goan spices, from cloves, black pepper, desiccated coconut, nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, chilies, all stacked in small quantities, while on the other side had flavored teas. You name them and you will  find the flavors ranging from pineapple, chocolate, coffee, keasar,cardamon,masala,peach,mint,lemon flavored tea and many more.The smell of bergamot, scandalwool, jasmine, rose, tulsi, Lemongrass, peppermint,mandarin,cedarwood, from the ayurvedic stall next to the spice shops created a harmonious essence, blended with the flavour of spices  made me feel a kind of spiritually high.Pashmina Shawls, Funky Tshirts for men and women, handbags, hammocks, tribal wear. Antique shops were in large number. The local vendors were putting up an  accent to negotiate hard with the Italian ladies, while a bunch of local tourists,  giiggling and gazing at the beautiful  ladies from a distance.  There were international painters, sketching  portraits of people who sat opposite and  looked still without a fixed fake smile expression, while the artist was trying to make it as perfect as it could get.  As time spent by, more crowd staring pouring in. The ambience got more cozy  in winters, with handsome men, beautiful women shopping around the colorful  market,  live music, soap bubbles flying around and the beautiful fragnance lingeing around.As I explored more inside the night market, the music became much louder and to my excitement, I landed up at the end of a  huge crowd cheering upto a English Rock Band; performing live with harcore bass guitars and  drums. The lead female singer with long blond braided hair, jumping on the stage with the beats of drums, the lead male with long hair bouncing high in the air, singing with his deepest passion was adding on to the killer  rock and metal element of music.  The multicultural crowd  from around the globe was terribly cheerful and pumped up, singing to the chores of the Jim Morrison’s and Elvis Presley numbers and amidst them I was awestruck, feeling Goa in its true form. I moved into different shops and asked for prices to check if the same was at par with the local market.  No doubt the prices at the Night market was high than any of the local market in Goa. You may even find similar things at any other state of India, or online but only when you negotiate the price, you can get a good deal.Food is major attraction at any destination, and we are always excited to explore.  At the extreme corner of the Saturday Night Market starts the array of food stalls, which is run by different nationalities, of  Asians, Italians, Mexican, Russians, Americans and from various parts of India namely Hyderabad,  Manipur, Chennai, Goa, selling their regional specialties of Food.read more on our website -- www.hungerknocks.com',\n",

       "  '    🇺🇦 LEARN MORE ABOUT UKRAINE:   🌎 TOURS BY LOCALS:   👩 MARGARITA:  🍺 RAMEZ:   🥟 ANNA:   🍻 MARIA:   My adventures in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, continued with me diving even further into its food and beer culture. Join me as I go on the ultimate Ukrainian food and craft beer tour of Kyiv, Ukraine!My afternoon kicked off on my way to an underground pub called Punkraft with Margarita, from Tours by Locals. 👕 DAVID’S BEEN HERE MERCH:   Inside, I met Ramez, who told me they have 24 types of beer on tap, most of which are Ukrainian. I went with the Hathor Milk Stout before heading into the kitchen, where they were grilling a ribeye steak with nothing added on it. I enjoyed a raisin-y Veligden IPA with my steak. The steak was perfect! It was local, juicy, and had a nice char on the outside.My next dish was Vorschmack, a popular Jewish dish that includes butter, pickled onions, cream cheese, apple, herring, and mayonnaise. You mix them all in a bowl yourself and eat it on toasted bread. I loved the briny herring, sweet apple, and creamy mayo! I paired it with a beer that contained salt and coriander. It cut the creaminess well.Next were vareniki, which are Ukrainian dumplings. They contain cherries and pair well with a Tonka Imperial Stout and sour cream. These vareniki were red because the dough was mixed with beet juice.The vareniki were sweet and juicy, and the sour cream wasn’t too sour. It was my favorite dish! The Tonka Imperial Stout was chocolatey, like a melted brownie! Next, Margarita and I walked through the lower town to our next stop, Kanapa, a restaurant located inside a large, 19th-century home. Anna showed me how to make two types of vareniki: potato and mushroom! I even tried to make some myself!At our table, we had homemade cordials, with is made of vodka, fruit, and berries. We also had red borscht, lard, black vareniki with bacon filling, pheasant pate, gelatin rabbit, and baked eggplant!The borscht contained beef, pork, plums, beets, and sour cream. It came with baked fat and raw fat. The first cordials was bitter!The borscht had so many flavors and was perfectly spiced. It was hearty, oily, and tasty! I enjoyed the raw, gelatinous lard and the baked lard with gooseberry. The berry cordial was amazing, as was the baked eggplant with red peppers. It was sweet and moist and came with a crispy potato chip. The rabbit meat in gelatin was an incredible combination with mustard. I followed that with a gingery cordial and the black vareniki with herring caviar, dill, and sour cream. They’re also stuffed with herring!The pheasant pate was incredible on bread. It was incredibly creamy! Then, they made an amazing blackthorn sorbet with liquid nitrogen at our table! We also had a chocolate ball containing pork fat and the most popular dessert in the city, Kyiv cake, which is crunchy and has many layers like baklava.The sorbet was sour and healthy-tasting, and the chocolate ball was so good! Meanwhile, the Kyiv cake was crumbly and contained cognac! The final cordial contained apple and hazelnut.They gave me a gift before I left, and we headed down to the Drunken Monkey Bar, where I met Maria. They have over 20 beers on tap. I started with a light and crisp Indian Pale Lager and some cheese balls, followed by a brown Imperial ale, a sour fruited gose, and their most popular beer, the Drunken Monkey IPA.Then, I had an Imperial stout and some amazing pate and marmalade on toast. Their Imperial pumpkin ale reminded me of Oktoberfest. They even gave me 4 beers for the road!Where have you been?Subscribe Here!  Top videos!

There will be some big changes coming to David’s Been Here in the coming months and years, and as my audience, I think you deserve to know why… 👕 DAVID’S BEEN HERE MERCH:   I’ve done a lot in my career as a travel content creator. I’ve traveled to 84 countries and over 1200 cities in my lifetime, and I’ve been creating videos and travel guides her on YouTube and on my website for over 13 years now. It has required constant travel—sometimes up to 7 huge trips per year, which has been hard on both me and my family. So, I’ll be taking a step back from huge trips and focusing more on my own backyard. Places I can visit that don’t require a full day of travel to get to. That means, the United States, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and parts of Europe. The trips will be shorter—3-5 days instead of my usual 14 days—so I can diversify my content more efficiently. I’ll also be working on filming more collaborations around Miami with other content creators, chefs, celebrities, and more. I have multiple new channels in the works, which I will talk a bit more at a later time. I want to share my passions with you guys, from food and culture on David’s Been Here, to fitness, to full-on documentary-style episodes chronicling my entire experiences in cities around the world, sharing the stories that didn’t make it in my regular episodes. I also explain why I don’t get involved in political conflicts in other countries around the world and why I feel it’s not my place to share my opinions. I also tease some ideas that have been brewing for a while and would love your input on them, so feel free to share your thoughts with me below! All in all, even though I’m proud of the work I’ve done, I want to make David’s Been Here even better. Better in terms of my own goals, but also better for you guys. I want you to get even more out of the content I create. You guys are the reason why I’ve been able to live out my dreams for over a decade, and I owe you that much. I love you guys so much. Thank you for everything, and I hope you’ll stick with me as we grow and expand David’s Been Here to new heights. I’m so excited to share even more of my ideas and passions with you, and I really want to build an amazing and inclusive community here. And I can’t wait for you to be a part of it. Love, David.

       "  '    🇺🇦 LEARN MORE ABOUT UKRAINE:   🌎 TOURS BY LOCALS:   👩 MARGARITA:  👨🏻\\u200d🍳 IEVGEN:    After landing in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, I immediately set out on my first Ukrainian food adventure! Join me as I try exotic modern Ukrainian food, including bees, before exploring the Old Town of Kyiv, Ukraine!My adventure began on a cold and sunny morning with my guide Margarita from Tours by Locals. We began our tour at the Golden Gate of Kyiv, a medieval city gate from the 11th century!  This gate was the main entrance to Kyiv! We also then went down to visit Zoloti Vorota Station, a beautiful ex-Soviet subway station that dates back to 1989!There are lots of gorgeous mosaics and pillars, and even pretty chandeliers hanging from the ceilings. Each mosaic is different!We then went back outside and saw a statue of Yaroslav I the Wise, one of the Grand Princes of Kiev. He built the city gate and fortified the city.Then, we drove through the historical center of Kyiv, which reminded me of old towns I’d seen in Poland and Hungary. There were lots of colorful mid-rise buildings!We arrived at Sto Rokiv Tomu Vpered Timeless Ukrainian Cuisine, where I met the head chef, Ievgen. After coffee, we went to their dining room, where Ievgen had several dishes for us.The first dish was made of fermented barley with pig fat and cranberry on top. I’d never had anything like it! It was sour, creamy, and sweet!Next was a fermented bread drink called kvass and a fermented beet kvass that reminded me of kombucha. I followed that with a roasted parsnip with smetana, a dairy product made by souring heavy cream. The dish was sweet, and he added some spices as well. Our next dish was an exotic one that included crunchy edible bees. Then, I dug into some banush, which is similar to polenta. It contained mushrooms and magnolia and mountain cheese.I followed the banush with chomber na dyko, or beef loin with herring and carrot puree. It was like a salty surf-and-turf. Next was vereshaka, which is pork ribs with wild oregano and a bread-thickened kvass sauce; a dumpling called galushi; a creamy baked gnocchi; and zucchini with shrimp sauce! Then, I tried his borshch, some tiny sprouts with black currant, and extra virgin sunflower oil!Next, Ievgen served me some hamula, which is a baked apple cake with cheese and chocolate. You eat it with a fork with a bit of lavender oil in a hole engraved in it!It was so good, and the scent of the lavender with it was an amazing combination. I’d never seen anything like it in my life! Then, I finished with some super spicy dehydrated tulip!Next, Margarita and I left and saw the bricks marking the boundary of Old Kiev Hill and a display of old relics under some Plexiglas!At the top of Old Kiev Hill, where we got epic views over the city, the Dnieper River, and the ruins of the first church in Kyiv. The church dates back to the 10th century and was destroyed in the 15th century.  Then, we visited St. Andrew’s Church, a colorful Christian Orthodox church!Two minutes away is St. Michael’s Square, where you’ll find the Cathedral of St. Sophia and the Cathedral of St. Michael. They were built in the 11th and 12th centuries. Outside is a mural of St. Michael, angels, and kings. The cathedral is gorgeous. The blue color represents heaven. Inside are lots of gorgeous paintings. Orthodox churches are always smaller than Christian or Catholic ones, and there are no statues inside.Then, we headed over to one of the oldest funiculars in Europe. One car travels down the hill, while the other travels up. We took it down to the lower part of Kyiv to end our adventure!Where have you been?Subscribe Here!  Top videos!

In this food vlog we had a blast , we enjoyed ourselves to the fullest. Firstly I picked neon man for the food court and we went to pizzawich and had some Cheesy garlic bread, and honestly the cheesy garlic bread was very tasty. Thereafter all my friends and i went to salua , Kharagpur , there we went to sewaro a shop that made unique momos and all kinds of Chinese menu. There we had veg spicy chili momos and chicken cheese momos. Thereafter we went to a special shop that has no name 😂.

Those who survived the seas made it to refugee camps all over Southeast Asia, from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, to Hong Kong. And eventually, some had a chance to resettle in America, Canada, Australia, and many parts of Europe. This is a story about three friends who found each other after 40 years. I met Giap in New Jersey a few years ago and he asked me to make a video about his life story. I agreed and after publishing it, two of Giap's refugee camp friends, who were also viewers of this channel, recognized him and saw themselves in my video. They reached out and I connected them to Giap. Giap connected his friends Thanh from Los Angeles and Phuong from San Diego together. They met right away.  Giap also met Phuong two years ago in Da Nang. But Giap just met Thanh and the three of them were finally together after 40 years.

       "  '•This stall serves variety of desserts, brownies, ice-creams, momos etc.I tried Chocolate brownie, Marshmellow chocolate dip and Hot chocolate fudge.My favourite is chocolate brownie and hot chocolate fudge. Everything is quite affordable at this stall and worth every penny. They pour lot of hot chocolate which makes it so tempting and delicious.•Hot chocolate fudge contains 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, hot chocolate, brownie and dry fruits. It was very crunchy and softy at the same time.Overall my experience is very good and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.',\n",

       "  \"► Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks:  We spent a whole day in and around Maat Village, Kasar Devi exploring the local food scenario at this breathtaking place. Along with the scenic location, it is the hippie trail that attracts travelers to this quiet village. Many western travelers and mystics have visited and settled down at Kasar Devi. This also includes many celebrities. Hence the food culture here is a mix of both local and international influences. On one hand you have the simple and soulful Kumaoni food while on the other there are popular western snacks, beverages and confectioneries. We started the food exploration with basic home cooked food at our homestay Rudra Himalayan Retreat. The spread consisted of gehat ki dal, lesu roti, kumaoni chawal, bichu saag ki sabzi, mooli ka thechua and aate ka halwa. These were the wintertime staple food at this place. After the meal our host Sanjay ji took us to two popular places that serve both local and a few international snacks and confectioneries. First destination was The Himalayan Hippies Cafe. It is a quaint cafe run by an enterprising Kumaoni girl named Charu. On reaching there Charu and her friend Minnie briefed us about the hippie culture as they perceived it and also shared some stories about their professional journeys. Then we were joined by the young members of a budding music band named Hope The Band, who enthralled us with two of their melodious compositions. Then together we tasted a healthy finger millet cake baked by Charu. It had a unique luscious taste that came from the chocolate, finger millet and little salt.From there we reached out final destination Baba Cake. The name of this quaint eatery is after the name of the genial owner Baba Tilaknath. The eclectic menu was a mix of some traditional and western classics. Baba Ji as he is fondly called learnt baking mostly from his in law's place in Germany. His cakes and pies are extremely popular with locals and visitors alike. We tried apple crumble, brownie and a warm platter of Munsiyari rajma chawal. The apple crumble, with its crusty base and jammy center was truly divine. And so was the rajma chawal because the kidney beans used in it were from the village of Munsiyari.Overall it was an fun experience trying the food at this scenic and calm town of Kasar DeviHOPE THE BAND  17.52 - 20.33 : Song - RANIKHET GHAR HAI MERA Full Song Link -  20.52 - 24.06 : Song - TAREEF TERI Full Song Link -  About the host - Anubhav Sapra  Anubhav Sapra is an avid culinary explorer who loves to travel and explore different cuisine primarily the street food, not just for the sake of gustatory pleasure but also for quenching his deep thirst for nurturing new cultural connections through the kaleidoscopic canvas of food.

       "  \"► Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks:  After exploring the food at Nainital we set out for Kasar Devi village in Almora. The picturesque and serene hilltop village is a perfect getaway for mountain lovers. And were on our way to know more about the food scenario over there. Interestingly the drive from Nainital to Almora had quite a few popular spots and food points which ought to be explored as we tend to get hungry during the journey.  So this episode brings you a delightful food experience from the 71 km journey between the two points.  Our first stop was a Fruitage outlet in Bhowali. It is a home grown brand that makes squashes, pickles, jams and honey from native fruits and vegetables that grow abundantly in these mountains. One of the quintessential and popular fruit concentrates is the buransh squash and that is what we purchased. It is made with Himalayan rhododendron flower juice. We didn't try it right away.  After another pleasant drive we reached Golu Devta temple in Ghorakhal. This fascinating temple full of thousands and thousands of bells is dedicated to the deity of justice Golu Devta. People come here to seek blessings for their court cases. They make wishes for such cases and when it gets fulfilled they come back and offer bells of different sizes as a token of gratitude and reverence. We were surprised to see the court papers hanging from the trees. These have been graced by the deity. Next we headed to the tea garden situated 1.4 km away from the temple because we were curious to learn about the Uttarakhand variety. It is open to tourists but due to Covid the visiting time has been curtailed. Mr. Joshi, the supervisor, gave us a brief tour of the garden and shared some snippets about the produce. After the tour we purchased one of their products and drove off to our next destination Kainchi Dham.  It is a peaceful, serene spiritual destination dedicated to Lord Hanuman. Surrounded by mountains and forests and a river flowing alongside, Kainchi Dham is a heaven for people who seek peace and calm. It has gained global attention after social media buzz about the visit of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg to this Temple. There are quite a few food points outside the temple that serve economical fare.  We tried two places. One was the Lemon Soda wala right beside the exit of the temple and the other was the Maruti Restaurant a few meters away. At the former place we had the most amazing lemon soda because it had a hint of green chillies in it. At the later one we polished off a plate of hot and crisp moong dal pakoda with an impressive kakdi raita.  Next we stopped at Kakarighat to try and to learn more about one of the key Kumaoni specialities, the Pisi Noon, from the organization that has been making it for the past 7 years. The enthusiastic and genial founder of Himalayan Flavours Sandeep, showed us around his small and delightful workshop cum store and shared some interesting snippets about this staple Kumaoni food item. With a mind blowing range of delicious hand ground flavoured salts, this place was a real delight. No wonder it is quite famous with the tourists and visitors.  This was our last food stop and after picking up a few of the flavoured salts we headed off to Kasar Devi. On reaching there we met our host Sanjay who took us to the Kasar devi temple and showed us around. The place became famous after Swami Vivekananda came to meditate in the temple premises and more so among international celebrities like Bob Dylan, Beatles guitarist George Harrison, singer Cat Stevens and other spiritual seekers from the West paid a visit. After the visit we went on to rest and get ready for the following day.

       "  \"► Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks:  After an amusing street food tour of Nainital with our young and dynamic hosts Aishwarya Bisht and Aparajita Kotlia, founders of Nainital’s first cloud kitchen named Ashtrogastronomy, the following day we were invited to their home to relish some Kumaoni delicacies included in their menu. On reaching there we were greeted in the traditional manner by Ashwarya's mother Vinita Ji. Then we joined the rest of the family for a chat. We got to know a few things about the demography and general lifestyle of this famous hill station. Soon after we landed at the kitchen with Ashwarya who, being a passionate chef, took the charge to introduce us to some Kumaoni culinary essentials and a few delicacies. For our convenience he had written down the menu on a blackboard placed at one corner of the kitchen.He took us through the delightful menu among which most of the stuff was prepared beforehand because of time constraints. After checking some Kumaoni essentials like gehat ki dal or horse gram lentil, jakhiya or wild mustard, bhang ke beej or hemp seeds and bhangira or perilla seeds we moved on to pan fry the gehat ke kebab. It was fascinating to learn Ashtrogastronomy's hot selling item is something that was born out of an inadvertent slip when Ashwarya's cook soaked horse gram dal instead of soyabean. To utilize the huge quantity of soaked horse gram, Ashwarya boiled and ground them and turned them into crisp, spicy and robust kebabs. Paired with some traditional chutneys, till date this recipe has won many hearts. After the crisp brown kebabs were ready, we joined Ashwarya's uncle over chang, the traditional alcoholic drink belonging to the bhutia community who are a substantial part of the population over here. He shared some insights about the drink and we moved on to have the food. First there was jakhiya aalu with Kumaoni raita and bangire ki chutney. Next was the turn of gehat the kebab with bhangira ki chutney. It was crisp on the outside and soft and dense inside. The chutney added a refreshing touch to the unique taste of the kebabs. The final dish that we tried, the sana nimbu, was also a stunner. This winter time treat made with sweet native lemons, yogurt and bhang flavoured salt was creamy, zesty and refreshing. We polished it off in no time. The food experience ended with a cup of unsweetened tea and jaggery. That's how the locals prefer it. We had an amazing time with the family learning about the Kumaoni food traditions. Thank you for watching!

       "  '🦞 Ultimate Lobster Roll Tour of Maine:  👕 NEW T-shirts and caps available now:  🥬 Cabbage Island Clambakes:  MAINE, USA: One of the experiences I was most looking forward to in Maine, was a New England clambake. It’s a method of cooking where a variety of seafood, plus potatoes and corn, are steamed and baked, sometimes underground, topped with local seaweed, over fire. When I was Cabbage Island Clambakes, I knew it was going to be epic!Friends in the video:🔹 Follow Jeffrey:   - Stop by at Heroic Italian ( ) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!🔹 Follow Jessica:  The journey begins from Booth Bay, a beautiful coastal town in Maine. We set off for Cabbage Island, with about an hour boat ride and tour of the harbor. When we arrived to Cabbage Island, I was excited and ready to see the clambake and eat. One of the great things about this clambake is that it attracts so many people, and therefore they cook such a huge quantity of food at one time - making it it even more of a delicious and visual experience.They had two full trays of lobster, 298 lobsters for lunch! Plus an entire tray of corn, potatoes, onions, and eggs. There’s a very interesting story where they used to use the eggs as a timer, when the egg would cook and crack, then the clambake and all the seafood would be ready. I’m happy that even though they don’t need the egg timer anymore, they have maintained the tradition.The clambake was incredible, I loved how all the ingredients steamed, baked, and roasted all at the same time. The lobster was probably the best I had in all of Maine. It was perfectly cooked, and some of the sweetest and juiciest lobster I’ve had. That clambake technique is without a doubt one of the best ways to preserve the taste of the fresh Maine lobsters. The clams - or I think in this case they were steamers, were also delicious. The sweet corn was among the best I’ve ever had, and the potato and eggs were great as well. Finally to finish you meal at Cabbage Island Clambake, you get their famous blueberry cake, which is famous for a reason - one of the best of the best blueberry cakes ever.And that completes the Cabbage Island Clambake experience. Highly recommended when you’re in Maine, and I think it’s one of the greatest USA, American food experiences you can have.Make reservations here:  Price - It was $72.50 per person🎵MUSIC:  ——————————————————🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here:  👕Get t-shirts and caps: ——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram:  Facebook:  🦞 Ultimate Lobster Roll Tour of Maine:  👕 NEW T-shirts and caps available now:  🥬 Cabbage Island Clambakes:  MAINE, USA: One of the experiences I was most looking forward to in Maine, was a New England clambake. It’s a method of cooking where a variety of seafood, plus potatoes and corn, are steamed and baked, sometimes underground, topped with local seaweed, over fire. When I was Cabbage Island Clambakes, I knew it was going to be epic!Friends in the video:🔹 Follow Jeffrey:   - Stop by at Heroic Italian ( ) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!🔹 Follow Jessica:  The journey begins from Booth Bay, a beautiful coastal town in Maine. We set off for Cabbage Island, with about an hour boat ride and tour of the harbor. When we arrived to Cabbage Island, I was excited and ready to see the clambake and eat.

This is the first part of the ultimate lobster and lobster roll tour of Maine! I can’t wait to share all the amazing lobsters, the juicy lobster rolls, and the amazing scenery of Maine with you.Friends in the video:🔹 Follow Jessica:  🔹 Follow Jeffrey:   - Stop by at Heroic Italian ( ) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey!In this first video of lobster roll eating in Maine, we went to 4 different places along the coast, a few amazing lobster shacks, and a few lobster pounds - which is the term used for waterfront shacks that have live lobsters.Five Islands Lobster Co - $19.95 per normal roll (we got the Big Boy for $44 per lobster roll) ( ) - Welcome to Five Islands Lobster Co, located in a spectacular location overlooking five islands. You can get their lobster rolls and their boiled lobsters, both are excellent choices. You are guaranteed extremely fresh lobsters from local fishermen.Day's Crabmeat & Lobster - $57.61 for all lobsters ( ) - Next, we go to Day's Crabmeat & Lobster, which is a lobster pound on the highway that has live lobsters. We got there a little too early, so they weren’t yet making lobster rolls, but we made our own. Again, you’re guaranteed fresh lobsters here.Red's Eats - $32.75 per roll ( ) - Red's Eats is probably the most famous lobster roll shack in the world, an iconic white and red shack on the corner of the road. Their lobster rolls are known for being huge and overstuffed, which is no joke. Their lobster rolls are legendary and great, but to me they didn’t taste as fresh as the other places. It was huge and fun to eat, but not the best.McLoons Lobster Shack - $22.95 per roll ( ) - Finally we drove out to McLoons Lobster Shack. First of all, located on an island, it’s one of the most beautiful locations for any lobster shack in Maine. The lobsters are kept in the seawater so again they are guaranteed to be fresh. But the real difference here is that the lobsters are steamed instead of boiled for your lobster roll. Jeffrey and I both agreed, best lobster rolls we’d ever had.An amazing day eating Maine lobster, and many more lobsters and lobster rolls to come!🎵MUSIC:  ——————————————————🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here:  👕Get t-shirts and caps: ——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram:  Facebook:  🌯America’s Best Chicken Tenders:  👕 NEW T-shirts and caps available now:  MAINE, USA - Welcome to the coast of Maine in New England, USA, one of the world’s best lobster destinations.

Dating back to 1917, Puritan Backroom is a cherished New Hampshire culinary institution. We’re getting an exclusive look into the kitchen to see how the chicken tenders are made, and then of course, I can’t wait to share with you the amazing meal.Friends in the video:🔹 Jeffrey Merrihue:   - Stop by at Heroic Italian ( ) in Santa Monica and say Hi to Jeffrey who is there most days!Puritan Backroom - Puritan Backroom Restaurant has a long history, where it first began as a candy shop, then they started selling ice cream, before finally opening as a family restaurant with all sorts of food. You will find classic American food, but also a long list of Greek influenced dishes. But by far the most popular food on their menu is their chicken tenders - which they sell thousands of pounds of them per week. The chicken tenders are marinated, then coated in a dry flour batter mixture, and deep fried to golden brown perfection. Moses did an amazing job to fry them perfectly without them being overcooked or dry, leaving them so juicy and moist - without a doubt the juiciest chicken tender I’ve ever had.Along with the deep fried chicken tenders, we also tried the broiled chicken tenders with special sauce. They were equally as delicious, so juicy and tender, with a legendary special sauce.Along with delicious family style American food and Greek food, Puritan Backroom is still family owned and operated and you can tell from the outstanding service as soon as you step inside. Thank you to all the staff and Tula for incredible hospitality.One more thing, Puritan Backroom is a favorite food stop on the US political campaign trail. And as has been said, there’s only one thing republicans and democrats can agree upon, and that’s the chicken tenders from Puritan!Total price - $122.24 for everything🎵MUSIC:  ——————————————————🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here:  👕Get t-shirts and caps: ——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram:  Facebook:  🌯 Mexican Street Food in Tucson:  📍 Puritan Backroom Restaurant:  👕 NEW T-shirts and caps available now:  MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE - Welcome to New Hampshire, my first time to visit, and we headed straight to Puritan Backroom to taste the original deep fried chicken tenders - they invented them - one of the great American foods!

Lets see if it can stand upto the recent hype its getting and be a worthy challenger to ' The Roasted Cart'We tried:Afghani Chicken Kebab: It was recommended to us as a speciality item. They have tried to giveAfghani chicken a new look as a kebab. The pieces of chicken were well marinated and smokey from the grill. But we found it a little under seasoned and for the price it just felt like a bit too costly of a deal.Price: Rs 150 for 5 piecesGrilled Pomfret:The size of the pomfret was aroun 100-150 grams, marinated in a tandoori masala. It was cooked well and the taste was also nice with hint of lemon and coriander. Only thing was the price tag of 100rs for a pomfret of this size seems a bit costly.Price: Rs 100 for 1 pieceGrilled prawns:Five pieces of medium size prawns marinated in a garlic masalas. The smokiness from the charred shells and smoke from the grill made the prawns delectable. With the green chutney and onions julienne it was a great combination. Its just that the price might turn off the customers a little.Price: Rs 150 for 5 piecesGrill on Wheels:60/12, New HIT Rd, Kadamtala, Bantra, Ichapur, Howrah, West Bengal-711101Google Map location:          100&Above's VLog on GRILLS ON WHEELS :  Escape Stories's VLog on GRILLS ON WHEELS :  In today's episode we are on a hunt to find some Roadside Roasted delicacies.

But we found it a little under seasoned and for the price it just felt like a bit too costly of a deal.Price: Rs 150 for 5 piecesGrilled Pomfret:The size of the pomfret was aroun 100-150 grams, marinated in a tandoori masala. It was cooked well and the taste was also nice with hint of lemon and coriander. Only thing was the price tag of 100rs for a pomfret of this size seems a bit costly.Price: Rs 100 for 1 pieceGrilled prawns:Five pieces of medium size prawns marinated in a garlic masalas. The smokiness from the charred shells and smoke from the grill made the prawns delectable. With the green chutney and onions julienne it was a great combination. Its just that the price might turn off the customers a little.Price: Rs 150 for 5 piecesGrill on Wheels:60/12, New HIT Rd, Kadamtala, Bantra, Ichapur, Howrah, West Bengal-711101Google Map location: \",\n",
